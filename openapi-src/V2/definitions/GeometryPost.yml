        For each geometry feature in the request (in order), this array contains the UUID assigned to that feature.
        If the feature was newly created, it will contain the new UUID; if it was detected as a duplicate, it will
        contain the UUID of the existing polygon in the database.
        For Point geometry, there will be one UUID per point and the order is preserved.

        Mapping of existing polygon UUID to the errors associated with the polygon. Currently, only duplicate detection errors are
        returned during create operations.
