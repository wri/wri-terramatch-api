description: |
  Takes an array of geometries and adds them to the sites indicated. For each geometry, it may either be a 
  single Polygon (in which case the site_id is required), or it may be a FeatureCollection of Points. If a geometry
  is a collection of points, then the site_id must be present on at least one of the points. If it is present on
  multiple points, all points within a given collection must have the same site_id. 
  
  For additional properties (plantstart, num_trees, etc) on Point geometries, if the properties are present on 
  multiple Points, the first non-null value for each is used.
