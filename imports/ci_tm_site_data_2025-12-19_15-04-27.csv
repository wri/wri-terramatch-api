Its physical construction began less than ten years ago as part of the process of territorial recovery and consolidation in the area known as the “exit to the sea” of the Kogui-Malayo-Arhuaco Indigenous Reserve.

This area has been historically affected by intensive cattle farming, characterized by a matrix of Guinea or Mombaza grass (Panicum maximum) and other weedy grasses in wooded pastures that once supported more than a hundred head of cattle. This livestock activity was discontinued following an asset expropiation process carried out by the now-dissolved National Directorate of Narcotics—currently the Special Assets Society—and the area was subsequently allocated for the development of ecological restoration processes coordinated between the competent environmental authority and the Indigenous community.

Although the area was subjected to intensive grazing pressure, the resilience of the natural environment - particularly from the soils - has favored both natural regeneration and assisted recovery in this territory, which is framed by the presence of important sacred sites belonging to the Línea Negra﻿.",The trees were planted with a spacing of 4 x 3 meters,Arboreal

","Bunkwamuke, also popularly known as Galaxia, is a territory of the Arhuaco Indigenous people located on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, near the Nabusimake River, within the larger Fundación River. It lies between 700 and 1,250 meters above sea level and shows high signs of landscape fragmentation caused by cumulative deforestation over recent decades. The creation and expansion of gardens or slash-and-burn plots within forest and secondary vegetation areas, along with vegetation burning events, are among the practices driving the observed fragmentation pattern.

The presence of eroded soils, areas affected by terracing, and overgrown pastures are indicators of the progressive deterioration of the landscape associated with livestock farming impacts. These livestock-use areas generally cover polygons with an average size ranging between 4 and 8 hectares. The best-preserved remnants of vegetation correspond to tall secondary growth located near natural drainage systems, which constitute potential germ-plasm banks that could support ecological restoration processes.",The trees were planted with a spacing of 4 x 3 meters,Herbaceous

","Bunkwamuke, also popularly known as Galaxia, is a territory of the Arhuaco Indigenous people located on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, near the Nabusimake River, within the larger Fundación River. It lies between 700 and 1,250 meters above sea level and shows high signs of landscape fragmentation caused by cumulative deforestation over recent decades. The creation and expansion of gardens or slash-and-burn plots within forest and secondary vegetation areas, along with vegetation burning events, are among the practices driving the observed fragmentation pattern.

The presence of eroded soils, areas affected by terracing, and overgrown pastures are indicators of the progressive deterioration of the landscape associated with livestock farming impacts. These livestock-use areas generally cover polygons with an average size ranging between 4 and 8 hectares. The best-preserved remnants of vegetation correspond to tall secondary growth located near natural drainage systems, which constitute potential germ-plasm banks that could support ecological restoration processes.",The trees were planted with a spacing of 4 x 3 meters,Herbaceous

This process made possible the partial recovery of the territory known as the “exit to the sea” of the Kogui-Malayo-Arhuaco Indigenous Reserve, located between the Don Diego and Palomino rivers, during the final decades of the twentieth century. The community is situated where the Lucuici River, El Puerco stream, and the Palomino River joint, between 250 and 1000 meters above sea level.

The most affected areas by deforestation in recent decades are concentrated in the northern, central, and western parts of this terriroty. However, it is important to note that this zone was heavily impacted by the presence of illicit crops until the first decade of the 21st century. Fires, cattle ranching and the expansion of the agricultural frontier remain historical drivers of change in the region. Around the populated center, there are areas of clean and weedy pastures, as well as mosaics of crops, pastures, and natural spaces.

These livestock-use areas generally cover polygons with an average size ranging between 4 and 8 hectares. The best-preserved remnants of vegetation correspond to tall secondary growth located near natural drainage systems, which constitute potential germ-plasm banks that could support ecological restoration processes.",The trees were planted with a spacing of 4 x 3 meters,Herbaceous

This settlement was founded as a pueblo talanquera in 2009, within the framework of the strategic project known as the “Environmental and Traditional Belt of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.”

The areas most affected by environmental degradation due to vegetation loss are found to the north and west of the populated center, while forested zones with low to minimal intervention are located toward the south and east of the territory. On the right bank—downstream—of the Ariguaní River, north of the settlement, there are degraded and/or clean lands with a history of significant overgrazing pressure.

Meanwhile, agricultural production areas (crops) are located in valley or floodplain zones near the Ariguaní River, within the community’s area of influence. Some areas affected by slash-and-burn practices, located farther from the main settlement, impact areas ranging from 3 to 5 hectares.
